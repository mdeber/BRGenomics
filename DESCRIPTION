Description: This package provides useful and efficient utilites for the 
    analysis of high-resolution genomic data using standard Bioconductor 
    methods and classes. BRGenomics is feature-rich and simplifies a number of
    post-alignment processing steps and data handling. Emphasis is on efficient
    analysis of multiple datasets, with support for normalization and 
    blacklisting. Included are functions for: spike-in normalizing data;
    generating basepair-resolution readcounts and coverage data (e.g. for 
    heatmaps); importing and processing bam files (e.g. for conversion to 
    bigWig files); generating metaplots/metaprofiles (bootstrapped mean 
    profiles) with confidence intervals; conveniently calling DESeq2 without 
    using sample-blind estimates of genewise dispersion; among other features.
